# DrumSetPy
This will be an interactive drumset controlled by a keyboard that makes noises.

Made with Python. 

Chose this project because I love music and coding basic applications. 

This project does have a few issues as stated in the README in the files of the project, but I am making a version 2 with a differnt setup.

To get to the file, go to "Python Drum Set.zip" and select the view raw option, and the file will download. From there you can unzip the file (right click then unzip. try to make sure this is within another folder).
